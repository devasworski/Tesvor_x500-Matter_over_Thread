## ðŸš§ Work in Progress. Contributions welcome ðŸš§

### Goal:
Replace the Wifi Chip within a Tesvor x500 with a ESP32 H2 to support Matter over Thread.

### Matter State Machine:
Not all States and state switches that are used within the matter protocol for Vaccumes are supported.
Oiginal can be found here: https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/e079364d2f18aae6c4718cd7074ea62fae3f0360/examples/rvc-app
I could find the following information being communicated to the wifi chip:
- Wake up
- Vacuum start
- Vacuum stop
- Charge start
- Stops Charging
- Power Mode
- Quite Mode
- Battery Percentage
No information about the docking status could be found.

This would allow for follwong state State Machine within Matter:
