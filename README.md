## ðŸš§ Work in Progress. Contributions welcome ðŸš§
 **Warning**
Matter 1.2 support is needed to use this. Currently no major Smarthome platform supports this. This will lead to a error similar to this:
*"This device is currently not supported in the Home App"*

### Goal:
Replace the Wifi Chip within a Tesvor x500 with a ESP32 H2 to support Matter over Thread.

### Matter State Machine:
Not all States and state switches that are used within the matter protocol for Vaccumes are supported.
Oiginal can be found here: https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/e079364d2f18aae6c4718cd7074ea62fae3f0360/examples/rvc-app
I could find the following information being communicated to the wifi chip:
- Wake up
- Vacuum start
- Vacuum stop
- Charge start
- Stops Charging
- Power Mode
- Quite Mode
- Battery Percentage
No information about the docking status could be found.

This would allow for follwong state State Machine within Matter:

### Matter 1.2 Device Library Specification Chapter 12. Robotic Device Types

#### 12.1. Robotic Vacuum Cleaner Device Type
This section defines conformance for the Robotic Vacuum Cleaner device type.

#### 12.1.1. Revision History
This is the revision history for this document.

| Revision | Description                         |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| 1        | [Initial release of this document](https://csa-iot.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Matter-1.2-Device-Library-Specification.pdf)    |

#### Classification
| ID     | Device Name              | Superset | Class | Scope    |
|--------|--------------------------|----------|-------|----------|
| 0x0074 | Robotic Vacuum Cleaner   |          |Simple | Endpoint |

#### Conditions
Please see the Base Device Type definition for conformance tags.

#### 12.1.4. Cluster Requirements
Each endpoint supporting this device type SHALL include these clusters based on the conformance defined below.


| ID     | Cluster                  | Client/Server | Quality | Conformance |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| 0x0003 | Identify                 | Server        |         |M            |
| 0x0054 | RVC Run Mode             | Server        |         |M            |

| 0x0061 | RVC Operational State    | Server        |         |M            |

#### 12.1.5. Element Requirements
The table below lists qualities and conformance that override the cluster specification requirements. A blank table cell means there is no change to that item and the value from the cluster specification applies.

| ID     | Cluster                | Element       | Name   | Constraint | Access | Conformance |
|--------|------------------------|---------------|--------|------------|--------|-------------|
